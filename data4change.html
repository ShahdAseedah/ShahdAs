									<p> Data 4 Change is a workshop where human rights organizations and journalists are paired up with researchers, 
									designers, and developers to create data visualizations that can help change the world. The need for the workshop 
									was first realized when organizers learned that human rights organizations in the MENA region collect primary data,
									and had a strong desire to visualize their research, but lacked the skills and access to professionals to do so.
									Therefore, the workshop which consists of five days, gathers representatives from human rights organizations from 
									around the world and connects them with creative web developers and graphic designers to assist them in turning 
									the data that they collect and document throughout their work into innovative presentations such as websites, 
									infographics, games, and more. <br />
									Recently, from November 25-29, 2016, I have been selected and invited as a web developer to be part of the 
									workshop in Beirut, Lebanon and joined 36 participants from England, Italy, Sudan, Egypt, Canada, Jordan, 
									Yemen, Morocco, United States, Palestine, India, Lebanon, and Germany to witness the production of six amazing
									visualized projects for six different human rights organizations. Each project went through the process of: 
									writing a concept for the project, which contains a title and 3-4 sentences to explain the story and the goals 
									of the project; researching for more qualitative data to cement the story behind the project; sketching how 
									the project will look like by the end of the workshop; and finally programming and coding the sketches through 
									the final output of the project. <br/>
									The participants were divided into six groups; each group contained researchers to collect information about 
									the issue and build a concrete narrative, developers to program and implement any technical tools required to
									visualize the data, and graphic designers to beautifully present the data to the end user in form of website,
									app, game, or others. For each group there was a human rights organization representative whom provided ongoing 
									guidance and a sense of what was expected from each team as a final visual product.<br/>
									I was part of the developer team for an Amnesty International organization, which is a global movement of more
									than 7 million people who take injustice. The organization currently owns a massive database of information 
									related to how much countries are welcoming refugees, yet there is no platform that shares that information with
									the public. As a team, our idea was to create a website that discloses all the details related to each location 
									hit by a website, we called it “the welcome Index”.<br/></p>

									The entire process of researching and developing a visual product in 3.5 days seemed to be a huge challenge 
									at the beginning, particularly that in the last two workshops by Data 4 Change the groups who participated have
									produced very high end visual products that, we as the participants of Data 4 Change 2016 workshop, had to live up to.
									Yet, it was inspiring to attend the group presentations due to the amazing projects that have been produced, and it 
									did not take long to realize that I have been working with an amazing group of young people. <br/>
									To add more richness to the workshop, there were three different inspirational speakers who provided a beautiful
									start to the workshop and motivated the participants with their own experiences and life knowledge. Later,
									during the workshop, and in order to encourage the participants to shine, selected participants were asked
									to present a tool they used, a project they implemented, or any other topic of interest via an interesting
									Japanese presentation method called Pecha Kucha, in which each participant has only seven minutes to present
									his/her material through 20 slides. For each slide there is only 20 seconds and then the image will move to 
									the next, and there is no going back. To add more innovation, before attending the workshop, the managing 
									team requested each participant install an app called Slack, which is a messaging platform through which
									participants were invited to get to know each other and allowed us to get familiar with the program in advance.<br/>
									The workshop has been a pleasant experience that added to my knowledge and expanded my horizon in thinking of 
									possibilities to avail the data collected by human rights organizations and use it in the best way. 
									I have met so many people from a great range of countries with a great deal of skills and expertise.
									It is without a doubt a golden opportunity for learning, networking, and putting one’s self out there.
									I am still in contact with the professionals I met through Slack, and I keep checking out news by Data 4 Change 
									on a daily bases, as I still have the feeling of belonging to their great concept.
